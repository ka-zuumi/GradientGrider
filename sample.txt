Facebook said Monday it suspended some 200 apps as part of its 
investigation and audit process in the wake of the Cambridge 
Analytica revelations.

The investigation is focusing on apps that had access to large 
amounts of user data before Facebook applied new restrictions 
on such practices in 2014, according to a company blog post. 
Following the suspensions, the company will do interviews, make
 requests for information and do audits including possible on-site visits.
